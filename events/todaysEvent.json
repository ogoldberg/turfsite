Sons of a Poet and a Microbiologist, they both took up music. Oliver moved to Atlanta and became a southerner. Chris moved to New York City and became a Yankee. Now, after years of musical and geographical separation they have reunited. Chris was living in Manhattan playing everything from free jazz to rock and roll. This is where he met his band mates to form Medeski Martin & Wood. Now The Wood Brothers have begun a collaboration that combines their shared childhood influences with everything they've learned since leaving home. Their music has a rootsy feel that blends blues, folk, and rock music in a guitar/bass duo.....................\r\n\r\npresale tickets at www.first-avenue.com\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <hr />\n                  \n    <\/div>\n    <br />\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n"}}
